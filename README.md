# 🛡️ Let's Defend Writeups
Welcome to my Let's Defend Writeups repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my investigation process, analysis, and lessons learned while working through various **use cases** on the [Let's Defend](https://letsdefend.io) platform.

## 📘 About
The Let's Defend platform provides hands-on experience in a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. This repository captures my responses to alerts, investigation workflows, detection logic, and remediation strategies as I explore real-world SOC scenarios.

Whether you're a SOC analyst in training or just curious about how cyber threats are investigated in blue team environments, you'll find actionable insights and learning resources here.
